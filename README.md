## Features

- **Manual flow** — select jurisdiction, trigger event, and date to instantly generate a full deadline schedule
- **Document upload** — drag and drop a court filing (PDF, PNG, JPG, WEBP) and Claude automatically extracts the jurisdiction, trigger event, and date
- **~90 deadline rules** covering FRCP, district local rules, and state civil procedure rules
- **Holiday-aware** — rolls deadlines forward past federal holidays and weekends
- **Court day support** — S.D.N.Y. and E.D.N.Y. business-day rules handled separately
- **Chained deadlines** — opposition triggers reply, complaint served triggers answer, answer triggers Rule 26(f), etc.
- **Verify links** — every deadline links to its primary source (Cornell LII, court local rules, state legislature)

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** + **Vite 5**
- Inline styles only — no CSS files (all tokens in `src/theme.js`)
- Direct browser-to-Anthropic API calls (`anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access`)
- No backend required

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

### 3. Set your API key

Click **🔑 Set key** in the top-right header and paste your [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/). It is stored in `localStorage` only — never sent anywhere except directly to the Anthropic API.

> **Note:** The API key is only required for the **Upload Document** feature. Manual entry works without one.
